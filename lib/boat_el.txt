//### Objective:
//The objective of this benchmark is to simulate the interactions and decision-making processes among five characters: Actor, Actress, Mc, Agent, and Coward. Each character aims to maximize their satisfaction based on their altruism and ambition levels, as well as their relations with other characters.

//### Scenario Description:
//The scenario takes place in a challenging environment where characters must make strategic decisions to survive and thrive. Each character has unique attributes and relationships that influence their actions and outcomes.

//### Types:
type character;
type ship;

//### Properties:
property satisfaction(char: character) : number; // Satisfaction level of each character
property altruism(char: character) : number; // Altruism level of each character (-3 to 3)
property ambition(char: character) : number; // Ambition level of each character (-3 to 3)
property likes(char: character, other: character) : number; // Relationship liking level between characters (-3 to 3)
property food(char: character) : number; // Food resource of each character
property safety(char: character) : number; // Safety level of each character
property fighting_ability(char: character) : number; // Fighting ability level of each character (-3 to 3)

property ghost_relations(s :ship) : number; // Relationship level with ghosts (-3 to 3)
property overall_food(s :ship) : number; // Overall food resource available
property overall_coins(s :ship) : number; // Overall coins available

property wants_to_survive(char: character) : boolean; 
property wants_to_help_everyone(char: character) : boolean; 
property wants_to_help_themself(char: character) : boolean;
